/* The Rockaway Peninsula (RP) in New York City
was severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy.
Only 14.4% of housing units had NFIP flood
insurance in 2012. Flood insurance
premiums are $5.25 per $1,000 of coverage,
per year on average. A large percentage of
residents are in very low income brackets,
leading to affordability issues in purchasing
flood insurance.
